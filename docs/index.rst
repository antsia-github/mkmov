Welcome to MkMov's documentation!
=================================

Welcome to MkMov. This utility is designed to make a movie from a NetCDF file or stitch together a series of *.png files. Interface is by command line and everything is done in one line!

Already have matplotlib, netCDF4 and ffmpeg? Jump straight to usage. Otherwise have a look at our install section.
