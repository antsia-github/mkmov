Welcome to MkMov. This utility is designed to make a movie from a NetCDF file.

We have tried to make this program as easy to install and use as possible.

Basic usage is as follows: 
::
    #First activate python environment that has matplotlib and netCDF4 packages..
    git clone ...
    cd mkmov
    python main.py FILE_PATH VARIABLE_NAME
That's it! A .mov file will appear in your mkmov folder with your movie.
